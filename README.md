# Dm All Members Script 

Due to the update of discord's API, user bots (selfbots) no longer are able to get a full list of members (can't get more than 10 members). So, now this script is limited to only discord bots and not selfbots.

You must have intents enabled on the discord developer portal
You must have discord.py installed (I'm using 1.7.3) and python installed (I'm using 3.8.9)
